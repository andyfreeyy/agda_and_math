# Readme -- Relational Approach to Logic

This is a agda file implementing my idea on a relational approach towards logic and language systems. Details can be found in my paper (which is not published yet). The abstract of the paper is written below:

**Abstract**. Generally speaking, there are two categories of semantics theory: model-theoretic approach and proof-theoretic approach. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, I will brieﬂy analyze some inadequacies related to these two approaches, and promote an alternative relational approach, which bases semantic notions on relations between expressions. A brief discussion in general for this alternative will be provided. In the second part, I will provide a solid mathematical framework to the study of logical meanings, and show its connection with the other two approaches.
